Here we run through a complete "pipeline" of structure analysiis that begins with a single sequence identifier and ends in a PCA analysis.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

## Step 1. Get a sequence
Retreive a sequence for the protein we are interested in. We will take ADK "1ake_A"

```{r}
id <- "1ake_A"
aa <- get.seq(id)
aa
```

## Step 2. Blast search
Run a BLAST search of the PDB for all related sequences to our input `aa`

```{r}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
hits <- plot(blast)
```

## Step 3. Download all structure
These are our "top hits" i.e. all the structures in the PDB database related to our input sequence.

```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

## Step 4. Align and superpose
